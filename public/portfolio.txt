Skillset Overview:
* Full-Stack Dev (Backend) - I have extensive experience with building full-stack web applications. I have a particular affinity for PHP / Laravel (LAMP/LEMP) when it comes to building a full-stack project, but I also have experience with many different libraries, frameworks, and languages. I know how to build proper RESTful API's, how to setup & configure http daemons (apache, nginx, etc..), database engines, and have a solid understanding of the entire http network stack. I know how to build & configure backend web applications from top to bottom and I'm very proficient in regards to server administration / DevOps capabilties in general.

* Full-Stack Dev (Frontend) - I have been building frontend user interfaces since the days of Internet Explorer 6 (ahhh!) and jQuery. Fortunately things have come a long way, and I now have experience with Angular, Vue, React, AlpineJS, and much more. I have a solid understanding of NodeJS and how to use it on the frontend & backend included. More recently I have been working with Svelte & SvelteKit, and I am particularly interested in using it to build a "Mono-stack" which allows me to build a frontend codebase once, and then have it work as a Single Page App(SPA), a Server Side Rendered app (for better SEO), and even the ability to deploy to native codebases. I have also been diving into InertiaJS, NextJS, and NuxtJS for similar reasons. I also have a solid understanding of CSS and know how to setup build processes for all of my frontend code. I have been working with Bootstrap for over a decade at this point, but I have recently come to love TailwindCSS & similar template frameworks such as WindiCSS.

* Responsive Design - I have a great deal of experience building responsive interfaces that function well on desktop & mobile devices. I have built many Single Page Applications, Progressive Web Apps, and also a few 'Native' mobile applications on iOS & Android using wrapper frameworks such as PhoneGap, Ionic, Expo, etc... I have experience tapping into native hardware API's & functionality such as push notifications, biometric hardware, camera & audio, gyroscope, etc... I have some experience with Java and Objective-C (and a tiny bit of Swift) when it comes to Android and iOS native apps. I have also worked with frameworks such as React-Native, Framework7, and various other native mobile-UI focused toolsets.

* Netsec & Penetration Audits - I have experience with various tools & methods to search for vulnerabilities, exploits, and attack vectors in remote systems. I have experience in analyzing systems that have already been exploited and know what to look for when trying to determine how an attack occurred. I also have experience in implementing various tools & techniques to harden the security of a system.

* Database Design, Querying, & Optimization. - I have extensive experience designing relational databases from the ground up. I understand how to structure new databases in order to scale properly, and also how to analyize existing ones to find bottlenecks. I know how to build structured queries, how to build more complex queries for data analaysis, as well as refactoring existing queries to be more performant. I have experience with very large databases, and I understand how and when to implement caching mechanisms, asynchronous processing, and various other optimizations. 

* Horizontal Scaling - I have experience building apps & processes that can scale. I know how to find bottlenecks, and how to break them down into synchronous & asycnhronous workloads that can be spread out across numerous servers, or even offloaded to a client's browser when appropriate. I know how to avoid premature optimization, but also how to avoid creating something that will become a big headache down the line. 


Miscellanous things I have experience with:
* Search Engine Optimization techniques & Tooling (website analysis / audit, tracking metrics, etc...)
* eCommerce systems, PCI compliance, ACID record keeping, etc...
* IRC servers (Unrealircd, inspircd, Anope, etc...)
* Matrix Server (Synapse)
* Chat bots for IRC, Matrix, Telegram, and Discord (and cross-network bridging)
* gFTPD Topsite (Distributed ftp) & Pre-DB.
* Torrent auto-uploader & irc #tracer channel
* Webtorrent & libp2p related file sharing & realtime communication.
* Bitcoin, Ethereum, & Binance daemon CLI blockchain tools (bitcoind, geth, web3, etc...)
* Ethereum Sniping Bot (decoding & building smart contracts)
* Statistical Analysis & Data Visualization (db querying, graph tooling, web based visual & interactive delivery)
* Reddit, Facebok, Twitter, Instagram API's & bots (codebulder jobbit bot, cross-posting bots, comment bot etc...)
* 3rd-party API's & dynamic HTML content parsing bots.
